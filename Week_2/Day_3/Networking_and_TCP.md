# Intro to Networking and TCP

A computer network is when 2 or more computers are connected and can communicate with each other.
- Can be connected *directly* or *indirectly*.
  - wifi -> indirect

## **TCP**

**Transmission Control Protocol**, provides a standard which allows machines to speak to each other

TCP allows two machines to establish an open channel for ***two-way*** data communication.
1. One side initiates connection through "dialing a number" called the **IP Address**
2. Each IP Address can have multiple numbers at the same location called **ports**
    - like phone number extensions
