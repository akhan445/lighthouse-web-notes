# Databases

**Database Management Systems**- are software that handle the storage, update and retrieval of data.
  - NoSQL and SQL databases

3 types:
1. Flat file
    - stores data in a file seperated by delimiters (, tab, etc)
    - simplistic
2. Relational
    - use SQL (for langauge)- Popular DBMS = PostgreSQL, MSSQL, MySQL
    - use case for pulling data from multiple tables to be used at once which is not possible with NoSQL
    -  
3. Non-relational
    - NoSQL- Popular DBMS = MongoDB, Couchbase, Amazon DynamoDB
    - minimally structured
    - data stored at key:value pair

**SQL**- Structured Query Language is a langauge that makes it easy to manage the requested data.
