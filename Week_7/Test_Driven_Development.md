# Test Driven Development

**GOAL** --> "Clean code that works"
- To achieve this we follow two rules:
    1. Write new code only if automated test has failed
    2. Eliminate duplication

## Red, Green, Refactor

This is the known process for test driven development
1. **RED**- write a small test that *doesn't pass*
2. **GREEEN**- Do the minimal amount of work to make the test pass
3. **REFACTOR**- improve the code, continuing to ensure all tests still pass


## Testing Culture

Testing should be part of the project's plan. Allocating time for writing and maintaining tests is essential to writing good, clean code.

GOOD TESTING === QUALITY
