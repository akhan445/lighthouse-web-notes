# Events

Front End = HTML + CSS + JS     === Client Side Programming (Focus on UI and user interaction related things)

Back End  = Node, Databases etc === Server Side Technologies

## **Tech Stack**

AKA *stack* refers to collection of technologies used in a given system

Example:
- Web Server: **Node.js**
- Middleware: **Express.js**
- Template Engine: **EJS**
- Database: **SQL or NoSQL**

Sometimes might also include infrastructure (depends on role): **Heroku**

| Popular Stacks |                                         |
|:--------------:|:---------------------------------------:|
|MEAN            | MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node         |
|MERN            | MongoDB, Express, React, Node           |
|MEVN            | MongoDB, Express, Vue, Node             |
|LAMP            | Linux, Apache (HTTP server), MySQL, PHP |

## **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**

Markdown in summay --> **When `X` happens, do `Y`**
- `X` is event
- `Y` is event handler

*This pattern works well with asynchronous programming langauge like JavaScript*

### **Client-Side (Browser) Events**

Browser related events- `onClick`, `onFocus`, `onLoad` etc.
- jQuery 

### **Server-Side Events**

events like incoming requests with callbacks that handle the event
